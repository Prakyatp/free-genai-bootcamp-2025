    Step 1: Breakdown of the Sentence
    We can divide the sentence into key parts:

    I am going
    to school
    to study Computer Science
    Step 2: Table of Key Words
    Here’s a table with important words and their forms in Kannada to help you form the sentence.

    Word Type	English Word	Kannada Translation	Tense/Action Notes
    Verb	go	ಹೋಗು (hogu)	Present Continuous: ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ (hoguttiddēne)
    Verb	study	ಓದು (odu)	Infinitive: ಓದಲು (odalu)
    Noun	school	ಶಾಲೆ (shaale)	-
    Noun	Computer Science	ಕಂಪ್ಯೂಟರ್ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ (Kampyootar Vijnana)	-
    Pronoun	I	ನಾನು (naanu)	-
    Adverb	to (direction)	ಗೆ (ge)	Used in dative case for direction
    Step 3: Sentence Structure
    To form the sentence, you can follow this structure:

    Subject + Verb + Direction + Purpose + Noun

    For example:

    I am going to school to study Computer Science.
    I + am going + to school + to study + Computer Science
    In Kannada:

    ನಾನು + ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ + ಶಾಲೆಗೆ + ಓದಲು + ಕಂಪ್ಯೂಟರ್ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ
    Step 4: Similar Example
    Let’s take a similar example to see how the structure works:

    English: "I am going to the market to buy fruits."
    Kannada: "ನಾನು ಮಾರುಕಟ್ಟೆಗೆ ಹಣ್ಣುಗಳನ್ನು ಖರೀದಿಸಲು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ"
    Here:

    I am going → ನಾನು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ
    to the market → ಮಾರುಕಟ್ಟೆಗೆ
    to buy fruits → ಹಣ್ಣುಗಳನ್ನು ಖರೀದಿಸಲು
    Step 5: Try Forming the Sentence
    Now, using the structure and the table above, try to form the sentence "I am going to school to study Computer Science" in Kannada.
