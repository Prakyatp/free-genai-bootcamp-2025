    Let me help you learn how to form this sentence in Kannada. Let's break it down systematically.

    Here's a focused table with the essential words and their forms:

    Action/Verb | Present Continuous | Infinitive Form
    ---------   |-------------------|----------------
    ಹೋಗು (go) | ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ      | ಹೋಗಲು 
    ಓದು (study) | ಓದುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ       | ಓದಲು

    Nouns            | Kannada                 | With 'to' (Dative case)
    ------           |---------                |----------------------
    School           | ಶಾಲೆ                    | ಶಾಲೆಗೆ
    Computer Science | ಕಂಪ್ಯೂಟರ್ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ       | -
    I                | ನಾನು                   | -

    Let's understand the sentence structure with a similar example:
    "I am going to library to read books"
    ನಾನು ಗ್ರಂಥಾಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಪುಸ್ತಕಗಳನ್ನು ಓದಲು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ

    Now, try to form your sentence following this pattern:
    ನಾನು + _____ + _____ + _____ + _____

    Hints:
    1. Start with "I" (ನಾನು)
    2. Where are you going? (Use dative case - ಗೆ)
    3. What are you going to study? 
    4. End with the action in present continuous tense

    Can you try filling in the blanks using the words from the table?
